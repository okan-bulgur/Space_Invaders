# Space_Invaders
I tried to make a game similar to Space Invaders using Java. In this game there are many kinds of Alien and you try to get the highest score by damaging them and collecting points. 

In the game you are given one ship for you at first, and you can buy new ships by collecting gold that falls at random times while you play the game. The amount of health, speed, bullet firing speed, bullet damage amount and bullet firing types of each ship differ. In addition, 4 types of special powers are randomly dropped during the game. You can catch them and get stronger for a short time. Strengthening times differ for each level. 

Special powers are as follows:
1) Increases your health by one point.
2) Accelerates your ship's speed for a certain period of time.
3) Accelerates your ship's projectile rate for a certain period of time.
4) Increases the power of your ship's projectile for a certain period of time.

At the top of the game screen: 
1) there is a section where you can see what percentage of the level you are at. When it is 100%, the defeat screen will appear.
2) You can see how much you have left.
3) You can see your username.
4) You can see your score in the current game.
5) You can see your highest score so far.

At any time, you can see how you rank among all users in the "High Score Table" area. You can also see the notification at the bottom of the screen when you break your own highest record during the game.
